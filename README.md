## **Self-bot for GroupMe**

### **About**
Self-bot for GroupMe is an automatic replier that reacts to certain keyword calls from the GroupMe chat that it is deployed in.

### **Basic Setup**
0. Some requirements:
   - In order to be able to launch this bot, you need a valid GroupMe account and Python 3 installed on your computer. Other necessary Python modules should be added when the bot starts.
1. Setting up credentials with `setup.py`:
     - To start out with setting up the appropriate credentials for the app, you first need to log in to the  [GroupMe Developers](https://dev.groupme.com/) website and request your personal token (this takes maybe like 30 seconds).
     - With your token, run `setup.py` by typing in

            py setup.py

          and copy-paste the token that you've just obtained.
     
            Welcome to Self-bot for GroupMe setup


            You can always run this file again to change anything.


            Did you obtain a user token from GroupMe? [Y/n]: Y

            Copy and paste the token right here below.

                    Token: 

         If you answer no to the question above, you get an option to be redirected to the [GroupMe Developers](https://dev.groupme.com/) website, from which you can get your token. It is important that you enter the correct token or you won't be able to launch the bot.

      -  You should then enter a user password that will be used to launch the bot. 

                Enter password for login    

                    Password:    

     - Your credentials will be saved in a `setup.json` file that you can always manually edit to make any changes. You can also run the `setup.py` file again to make changes.
2. Starting the bot with `bot.py`:
    - Now that all of your credentials are set up, you run the `bot.py` program start up your bot. 
        <p> In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the program is type in something like: </p>

          py bot.py

        <p> The program will first check and install some necessary modules. When that is completed, it will prompt you to enter a password.</p>

            Enter Password to Login: 
        
        <p> Simply enter the password that you set up previously to proceed. If the wrong password is entered, the program will simply exit.</p>

        <p>Once you've entered the correct password, the terminal will show the following screen:</p>

            Available Channels

            [1]  Channel 1
            [2]  Channel 2
            [3]  Channel 3

            [0]  Exit

            [INPUT CHANNEL NUMBER] >>>

        <p>Just enter the number corresponding to the channel that you would like to deploy the bot in. If the following message is sent to the group chat:</p>

        > [Your first name]bot Activated ü§°

        <p>then the bot was successfully set up, and now is ready to do some interesting things.</p>

3. Calling the bot
   - The bot can be called from the chatroom by the `$[Your first name]bot` keyword followed by any *command* keywords
   - Some *command* keywords include: 
     - `echo` - replies with the last message sent before the bot call (the bot does not reply with any bot calls as that could cause problems).
     - `time` - replies with the current time.
     - `hi` - replies with 
       
       > Hi [Caller full name] üòÄ! 

     - `like` - likes the last message sent before the bot call...TWICE!
     - `deactivate` - raises a `KeyboardInterrupt` that deactivates the bot.

   - The terminal will constantly update and look for new bot calls. As of right now, the most recent 2 chat messages are shown, but this can easily be changed within `bot.py`.
   
            Current Channel: Test Self

            [01]         [Caller Name] :  $[Your first name]bot approve
            [02]            [Bot Name] :  I approve üëç

            Updated: 04/17 00:00:49

4. Taking down the bot
   - The simplest way to take down the bot is just to kill the terminal that currently hosts it, but another way to do this would be to press the `Quit Bot` button on the small UI window
  
     ![UI quit](images/quitter.PNG)

     <p>Pressing the button will signal the chatroom that the bot has been taken down by sending:</p>

     > [Your first name]bot Deactivated üò¢


### **Features as of 4/17/2022**

    - `dictionary` - replies with a dictionary.com search url

    > Here's what I found: https://www.google.com/search?q=Detroit+Tigers
- **Wordle**
  - Users in the chat are able to play a simple wordle game by adding their word guesses after the `wordle` keyword.
  
    <p> With the message: </p>

    > $[Your first name]bot wordle hello

    <p> The bot would send an image of a wordle board at its current state: </p>  

    ![Wordle start](images/hello.PNG)

  - The game doesn't reset until the current one is over or someone guesses the correct word.
    <p> If no one can guess the right word, the bot replies: </p>

    > Everyone loses üò•. The word was GRUFF.

    <p> Or with whatever the correct word was. </p> 
    <p> Else if someone is able to come up with the correct word, then the bot replies: </p>

    > [Someone] Wins! 

    <p> Where [Someone] would be the first name of the person who guessed right. It also shows you the picture of the nice board. </p> 
    
    ![Winning](images/winner.PNG)

    - not 5 letters long, or
    - is not in the `words.txt` file included in the same directory.
    <p>In each case the bot points out what's wrong: </p>

    > Invalid word length!
    
    <p>or</p>
    
    > Invalid word input!
